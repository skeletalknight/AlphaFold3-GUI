## Prerequisites

Before using AFusion, ensure that you have the following:

1. **🐳 Docker Installed**: Docker is required to run AlphaFold 3. Install Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

2. **🧬 AlphaFold 3 Installed**: AFusion requires AlphaFold 3 to be installed and set up on your system. Follow the installation instructions provided in the [AlphaFold 3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) to deploy AlphaFold 3.

3. **🐍 Python 3.10 or Higher**: AFusion is built with Python and requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Installation and Running

1. **Install AFusion**

   Run the following command in your terminal to install AFusion:

   ```bash
   pip install afusion
   ```

2. **Run AFusion GUI**

   After installation, you can start AFusion by running:

   ```bash
   afusion
   ```

   This will launch the AFusion graphical user interface (GUI) in your default web browser.

**Please Note:**

- **🧬 AlphaFold 3 Installation**: Ensure you have correctly installed AlphaFold 3, including model parameters and required databases, following the [AlphaFold 3 Installation Guide](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

- **⚙️ Docker Configuration**: After installing Docker, make sure it is running properly and that your user has permission to execute Docker commands.

- **📦 Streamlit is Included in Dependencies**: AFusion's installation will automatically install all required dependencies, including Streamlit. There's no need to install it separately.

If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, please refer to the relevant official documentation or contact us for support.

## Usage
