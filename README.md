## Prerequisites

Before using AFusion, ensure that you have the following:

1. **🐳 Docker Installed**: Docker is required to run AlphaFold 3. Install Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

2. **🧬 AlphaFold 3 Installed**: AFusion requires AlphaFold 3 to be installed and set up on your system. Follow the installation instructions provided in the [AlphaFold 3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) to deploy AlphaFold 3. **Or you can run step-by-step GUI by**:

   ```bash
   afusion install
   ``` 

3. **🐍 Python 3.10 or Higher**: AFusion is built with Python and requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Installation and Running

1. **Install AFusion**

   Run the following command in your terminal to install AFusion:

   ```bash
   pip install afusion
   ```

2. **Run AFusion GUI**

   After installation, you can start AFusion by running:

   ```bash
   afusion run
   ```

   This will launch the AFusion graphical user interface (GUI) in your default web browser.

**Please Note:**

- **🧬 AlphaFold 3 Installation**: Ensure you have correctly installed AlphaFold 3, including model parameters and required databases, following the [AlphaFold 3 Installation Guide](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

- **⚙️ Docker Configuration**: After installing Docker, make sure it is running properly and that your user has permission to execute Docker commands.

- **📦 Streamlit is Included in Dependencies**: AFusion's installation will automatically install all required dependencies, including Streamlit. There's no need to install it separately.

## Usage

### Launching AFusion

1. **🚀 Start the Streamlit App**

   From the project directory, run:

   ```bash
   afusion run
   ```

2. **🌐 Access the Application**

   - The application will launch, and Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
   - Open the provided URL in your web browser to access AFusion.
